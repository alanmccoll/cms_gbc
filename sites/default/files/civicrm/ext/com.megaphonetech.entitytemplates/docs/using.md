# Usage

## Creating a template
* Go to **Administer menu » Customize Data and Screens » Entity Templates**.
* Choose the entity type you'd like to create a template for.  Currently, "Individual", "Organization" and "Contribution" are supported.
* Press the **Add Template** button.
* Fill in all the fields as if you were creating a new record of this type.  Add a template title in the appropriate field at the top.
  * Data that's stored with other entities but entered from these forms (e.g. tags, groups, custom fields) are all supported.
* Press **Save**.

## Viewing/Editing/Deleting templates
* Go to **Administer menu » Customize Data and Screens » Entity Templates**.
* You will see a list of templates, filtered by the entity type at the top of the screen.  Press **Edit** to view/edit the template and **Delete** to remove it permanently.

## Using a template
* Once you've created at least one template for an entity, you should see a dropdown to select the template when creating a new entity of that type.  See the screenshot below as an example.  Selecting a template will reload the page with the appropriate selections from your template.
