# Entity Template

#### com.megaphonetech.entitytemplates

## Overview

This extension allows you to create templates for Contacts and Contributions.

Templates will pre-fill your "New Individual", "New Organization", and/or "New Contribution" screens with values you've pre-selected.  This includes custom fields and tags/groups.  Perhaps you have a regularly scheduled event that brings in new constituents that need the same "Source" field and are tagged/grouped the same way - this will cut down on repetitive data entry.
